## **Backstory**

This was one of the first projects to come my way when I joined in 2018; A large set of paying customer bring data from other systems and the experience of setting the system was tedious both for the Customer and the implementation teams.
This project involved migrating data from other systems to a new platform, which was a tedious process for both the customer and implementation teams. 
There was a Google sheet which kept track of the various tasks and the statuses. The success team initially reached out to understand how we can remove the frictions in the existing process. 

**Design Team** - Sathyan, Ruthiran
## Spoiler
We designed a solution(a small product) but it never got built; 
This roadmap items always won the votes for experience improvement during prioritisation but in the lens of dollar value, a smaller *tooling* always got prioritised. 
But the learnings were plenty and the designs and ideas always found its way in future projects such as PLG experiments, Onboarding, etc.,
## How did we go about it?
It took me 3 months to understand all the parts of the migration journey, the tools involved and the frictions and this journey was captured in Miro
We mapped the journey and identified areas that can be productised. 
**Story document** captured a couple of high level approaches and this was validated with internal stakeholders
A sharing workshop with huge printouts of the solution - led to a discussion and a possible path to build
*We kept losing the priortisation excercise every quarter and the Migration teams explored other tools such as [Monday.com](http://Monday.com) to help make parts of the journey better based on the findings.*

Hypothesis
Setting Expectation, Clear status and progress will increase successful migration
### **Outcomes**
* Personally, this exercise helped me understand the various parts of the customer journey
* It helped Design better capture ideas and present > We still have a single slide of each idea and have implemented many of the explorations in other areas.
* It helped me understand and better emphasise with the Product management practice
* Naming approaches helps in product building
