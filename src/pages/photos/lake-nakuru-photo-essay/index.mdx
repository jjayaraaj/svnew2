This was my second time in Africa after Ghana(Nov-Dec 2011 during field research). This time it was to participate in the GSMA mAgri quarterly team meeting; You can read more about this work here. 

This was also last outing I had with Nikon D90(I will get a Full Frame Sony Alpha III in Oct 2020). During the layover at Qatar, I managed to get a handycam for capturing videos - I didn't want to miss out anything that I see. The gear is all set. I normally carry the cheap telephoto lens by Tamron, the stock 18-105 mm which has the VR - my go to lens and the Prime 35 mm Nikkor lens(I don't remember ever using this for the trip). I also had the GoPro attached to the Toyoto van 



The journey started in a Toyota van from the central Kenya and we were able to get a glimpse of the Rift valley in a couple of hours

I was all set to see the big 5 in Kenya. We did see all of them. Having seen a few in Sri Lanka, I was hoping to see a leopard, but we were not lucky;
