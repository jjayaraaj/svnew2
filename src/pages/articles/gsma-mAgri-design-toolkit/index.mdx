    The mAgri Design Toolkit is a collection of instructions, tools, and stories to help develop and scale mobile agriculture products by applying a user-centered design approach.

I started working on the mAgri project as UX Consultant for Dialog mAgri Product, Sri Lanka. The project is live in 6 countries Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Ghana and Malawi.

A lot of our learnings have been compiled in this amazing toolkit by GSMA and Frog. The toolkit from GSMA is divided into 6 useful modules â€“ Intro to UCD, Plan, Learn, Create, Develop and Maintain,  and will come handy for  anyone who is working on a mobile product for the BoP. The case studies and tools used go beyond mobile Agriculture.

Happy learning!!
